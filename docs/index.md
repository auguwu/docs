# August's Documentation Site
This is a showcase of documentation available to what I create, from NPM packages to Java packages on the `packages.floofy.dev` registry! This is automated per project under `docs/` folder, so if you want to update any documentation,
create a PR in that project of your changes [here](https://github.com/auguwu/docs).
