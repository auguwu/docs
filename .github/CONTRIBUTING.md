# Contributions
Thanks for thinking on contributions! Every little piece of help always goes a long way, if you want to update the codebase or update any misspellings, then you did the right choice! Read below of how to make a contribution.

## Note
Before we get started on setting up, your icon and name will be on the **Edited by** footer if you decide to contribute!

## Setting Up
First, you will need to have ESLint and TypeScript installed on your system to continue the process. You can install them using ``npm i -g eslint typescript``.

- Fork the repository [here](https://github.com/auguwu/docs/fork)
- Clone the repository to your local machine (``git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/docs``)
- Change the directory to the cloned repo (``cd docs``) and create a seperate branch (``git checkout -b <branch>``)
- Install any local dependencies from NPM (``npm i``)
- Update the codebase or documentation
  - Test your changes with ``npm run dev`` or ``yarn dev``!
- Then, submit your [pull request](https://github.com/auguwu/docs/compare) and wait a few minutes or a few hours for the maintainers to look at your Pull Request and ask for any changes or it'll be merged.
