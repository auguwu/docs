# Welcome
Welcome to the documentation site of all of my projects! If you like what you see, star the [repository](${redirect:github.com/auguwu/docs}) or maybe contribute if you see any problems.

I currently maintain [eris-commando](${redirect:/eris-commando}), [Laffey](${redirect:/laffey}), [Ichigo](${redirect:/ichigo}), [Immutable](${redirect:/immutable}), and [sysinfo](${redirect:/sysinfo}) libraries on NPM and this is the documentation for all of those libraries.
